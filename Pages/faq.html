            <p id="bold">1. When is the best time to visit Chapada of Veadeiros?</p>
            <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                <p>The region has a dry season (from April to September) and the rainy season (from October to March). There are tours that are better during the flood season and others in the dry season. For example, the Canyons, the Couros Falls, the Segredo Waterfall among others, are impassable in the rain, while Loquinhas and the Anjos and Arcanjos Waterfalls are too thin in the drought. There is an appropriate itinerary for each season.</p>

The child price is for ages zero to 12. Due to the greater need for structure and care for young children and babies, we include them in child values. In the pool, children must be accompanied by an adult. There are some very suitable waterfalls to take them to.</p>

            Even in the waterfalls that are just a few kilometers from the city or town, there is no place for pedestrians on the roads. The only road transport company to Alto Paraíso is Real Expresso - Phone: (61) 3234-8774</p>

       <div class="answer" id="answer8"><p>If you cancel up to 2 days in advance (that is, until 9 am two days before the reservation date), 80% of the amount deposited will be refunded. After the deadline (less than 1 day before booking or after check-in time), the amount deposited will no longer be refunded. This policy is necessary as our places fill up far in advance and we deny hundreds of reservations due to this. When a person quits at the last minute, it is no longer possible to replace that vacancy and not only do we lose the daily rate during a period of high demand, we also lose the opportunity for more people to get to know our business and gain more customer loyalty.</p>
