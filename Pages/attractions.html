                    The trail of more than 2 km is not long, but difficult. Two great waterfalls, although their waters
                    are very clean, they are dark in color like Coca-Cola due to the high concentration of tannin
                    (vegetable compound), creating a beautiful effect in the sunlight. It is 12 km from Alto Paraíso in
                    the village of Moinho.</p>

                        last pool located at a large viewpoint. The forest is very pristine, and the water is crystal clear.
                         Due to the challenging car access, it is one of the less frequented places. A full day is required for the excursion.

                        involves a significant uphill climb on the way back but offers breathtaking beauty at every step. 
                        The Rio Preto Waterfall, standing at 120 meters in height, is the park's iconic landmark, and the Garimpão Waterfall,
                         at 80 meters, completes the journey, providing an opportunity for swimming.</p>
